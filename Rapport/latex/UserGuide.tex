If you choose ``New Game``, it will start up the game, while if you choose ``Quit``, it will Quit the game. So if you choose ``New Game`` the game will start, where you will see your ship in the top right corner of the screen placed beside the sugar cane on the left side. The game will begin when you press one of the keys. Then the ship will begin to fall and will keep falling until you hit an obstacle and explode or when you hit the up key that gradually will stop the ship from falling and push the ship upwards. You can also move the ship to left and right. However, be careful as your ship is being affected by physics (gravity and acceleration). If you are going too fast or moving your ship uncontrollable, you may hit an obstacle on the way and the cause will kill both you and your customer. To move your ship, you will use the following keys:\\

\end{figure}

From here on, you should drop off your customers at their desired destination (next platform) in time or they might get angry at you and pay less money.\\

\newpage

To get to the next level when finished the current level, you should collide with the portal up in the top middle of the screen, that will teleport you to the next level.
