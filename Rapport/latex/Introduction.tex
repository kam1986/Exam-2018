\section{Introduction}
In this project we should use the game engine ``DIKUArcade`` to create a simple version of the game Space Taxi. We were introduced to this game engine in the last project Galaga, where we should learn how to use it. Now we have to use our knowledge from the last project and expand our vision by learning to use the features more effectively to make our next game ``Space Taxi``.\\

This report consists of all our work on implmenting a simple version of the game \textit{Space Taxi} in C\# using JetBrains Rider, which is part of the course \textit{Software Development 2018} at \textit{The University of Copenhagen}. It features: a backgound explaining the purpose of our work and the history of the game. An analysis, explaining our goals within the project, as well as the requirements to the game. A description of the design we have chosen, and a talk about the implmentation. A user guide, an evaluation and a conclusion on our work process.
